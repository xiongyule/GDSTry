# Plugins: FDTD

FDTD: Finite difference time domain wave propagation. Provides broadband wavelength spectrum for a component  described as Sparameters (ratio of output/input field for each port) as a function of wavelength.

FDTD simulators can compute the [Sparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_parameters) response of a component, which measures the input to output field relationship as a function of wavelength or frequency.


For Sparameters we follow the syntax `o1@0,o2@0` where `o1` is the input port `@0` mode 0 (usually fundamental TE mode) and `o2@0` refers to output port `o2` mode 0.

Sparameters are common in RF and photonic simulation.
