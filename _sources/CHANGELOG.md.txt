## [5.15.3](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/pull/579)

- [PR](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/pull/576)
    - fix offgrid ports connect
    - Component.copy() and Component.flatten() don't assign fixed names to the output Component which could create name collisions. It is safer to keep the new cell's default name (with UID) to prevent this. The thought is that even a copied or flattened cell should be eventually placed inside a cell function with @cell decorator, which will remove the anonymous and unpredictable names (for those of us who care). And for those who don't care as much, at least they won't get dangerous side effects!

## [5.0.6](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/pull/279)

- fix set active PDK on component_from_yaml

## [5.0.5](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/pull/278)

- implements `get_active_pdk()` and `set_active_pdk()` functions to avoid side-effects of using ACTIVE_PDK global variable in different scopes. Renames `ACTIVE_PDK` to `_ACTIVE_PDK` to make it private, and instead promotes `get_active_pdk()`
- fixes instances where cross_section was specified and/or used as a factory rather than CrossSectionSpec
- fixes cases where cross_section was directly called as a function rather than invoking get_cross_section(cross_section) pattern
- Section.layer type needs to be the Union of Layer and Tuple[Layer,Layer] as long as we use the current implementation of Transition

- difftest adds failed test to logger.error, to clearly see test_errors and to log test error traces
- clean_value calls clean_value_json, so we only need to maintain one function to serialize both settings and name
