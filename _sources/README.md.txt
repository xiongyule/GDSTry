GDSfactory is a design automation tool for photonics and analog circuits.

You can describe your circuits with a code driven flow (python or YAML), verify them (DRC, simulation) and analyze them.

Multiple Silicon Photonics foundries have gdsfactory PDKs available. Talk to your foundry to access their gdsfactory PDK.

You can also access:

- open source PDKs available on GitHub
    * [UBCPDK](https://gdsfactory.github.io/ubc/README.html)
    * [skywater130](https://gdsfactory.github.io/skywater130/README.html)
- instructions on [how to build your own PDK](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/notebooks/08_pdk.html)
- instructions on [how to import a PDK from a library of fixed GDS cells](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/notebooks/09_pdk_import.html)



You can:

- define parametric cells (PCells) in python or YAML.
- define routes between components.
- Test component settings, ports and geometry to avoid regressions.


As input, you write python or YAML code.

As output you write a GDSII or OASIS file that can send to your foundry.
It also exports component settings (for measurement and data analysis) and netlists (for circuit simulations).

It provides you a common syntax for layout (klayout, gdspy), simulation (Lumerical, tidy3d, MEEP, MPB, DEVSIM, simphony, SAX, ...) and data analysis libraries.
