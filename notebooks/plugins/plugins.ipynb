    "We try to keep gdsfactory core with minimum dependencies.\n",
    "So when you run `pip install gdsfactory` you do not install any plugins by default.\n",
    "If you want to install gdsfactory together with all the plugins you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install gdsfactory[full]\n",

    "Here are some of the plugins that you can use in gdsfactory:\n",

    "### Trimesh\n",

    "For (3D rendering and STL export)\n",

    "## Component simulation\n",

    "- Mode solver. Frequency Domain solver to compute modes for different waveguide geometries. Single frequency/wavelength solving. Solve modes supported by a waveguide cross-section\n",
    "  - MPB. See `gdsfactory.simulation.modes`\n",
    "- FDTD: Finite difference time domain wave propagation. Provides broadband wavelength spectrum for a component  described as Sparameters (ratio of output/input field for each port) as a function of wavelength.\n",
    "  - lumerical Ansys FDTD. See `gdsfactory.simulation.lumerical`\n",
    "  - meep. See `gdsfactory.simulation.gmeep`\n",
    "  - tidy3d. See `gdsfactory.simulation.gtidy`\n",
    "\n",
    "FDTD simulators can compute the [Sparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_parameters) response of a component, which measures the input to output field relationship as a function of wavelength or frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparameters are common in RF and photonic simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency circuit simulations solve the Sparameters of a circuit that connects several components, each of which is described by its Sparameters.\n",

    "## Store / cache simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most plugins leverage a file based cache, where you can store simulation results in files to avoid running the same simulation twice.\n",
    "This saves you a lot of computation time, as each FDTD simulation can take several minutes, or big simulations can take even hours.\n",
    "There are different types of simulation storage that you can use.\n",
